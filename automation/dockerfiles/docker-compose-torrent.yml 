  # NOTE: With protonvpn, the port forwarded isn't guaranteed to be stable 
  # The port has to be manually set instead.
  # To automate some of this, there's opt/cron-scripts/qbittorrent-portforward.sh,
  # which I personally run outside docker, because I'm not setting up an entire
  # account and image for something this trivial
  # Feel free to steal the script and shove it in a docker container, but this
  # is the path I've gone down.
  # Also note that the script requires ntfy cli, and posts to alerts with a priority
  # of 4 if anything fails. Remove those lines if you don't have ntfy
  # Also note that the gluetun location is hard-coded, just in case 
  # stuff changes
