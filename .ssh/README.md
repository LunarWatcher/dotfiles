This is a copy-pasta client-side template for my ssh config, primarily because I inevitably will fail to sync it to certain devices via my private backchannels.

It does not contain any sensitive information, and isn't really useful to anyone outside my network, but it does demonstrate how I deal with remote ssh management that might be useful if you need creative ideas for stuff:tm:
