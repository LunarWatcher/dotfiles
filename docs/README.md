# Setup procedures

This folder contains setup procedures for the different configurations supported by the makefile.

> [!WARNING]
> **If you aren't me, you should not follow these instructions**. This installs a lot of very opinionated and very user-specific stuff, and will steamroll anything you have that conflicts with the files or standards imposed by the makefile. If you just want my dotfiles, copy them manually. You should not run the makefile unedited.
