## Folder names

### Programming folder

Unless otherwise necessary, `~/programming/` is the code folder. In the future, it may be renamed to `~/code/`, if I feel like renaming it and dealing dealing with the consequences of it. 

This folder can contain the following folders:
* `~/programming/dotfiles`: This repo; also the default assumptions in all configurations.

Additionally, **home configurations** (including servers) have the following subfolders:
* `~/programming/misc`: Contains anything that isn't a single language
* `~/programming/<language name>`: The main rule is to sort by 

Unless otherwise necessary, **work configurations** and **specific-purpose servers** have project folders as immediate descendants of `~/programming/`, and do not sort projects any further. This is due to a significantly reduced set of projects in a work context, or in specific-purpose servers. This decision is purely made to save on typing where possible. There's no point in sorting projects any further in cases where there's realistically only going to be a few stored projects.

On home configurations, particularly my main machine, I end up having *many* stored repos due to cleanup not being necessary.
