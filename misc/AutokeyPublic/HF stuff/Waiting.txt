All PRs have to wait for 7 days before they're counted towards completing Hacktoberfest. This is an anti-spam measure, and ensures there's enough time for the maintainers to check the PR, and for Hacktoberfest's organisers to ensure the repo complies with [Hacktoberfest's values](<https://hacktoberfest.com/values>). You have to wait the full 7 days for the PR to be counted. The timer may be stuck at 0 for a little while, but this is caching and will be sorted out eventually. Be patient - hacktoberfest is not a race.
