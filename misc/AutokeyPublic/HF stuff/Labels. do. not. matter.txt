Issue labels do not matter. Only the `hacktoberfest` topic (without a year) on the repository matters for repo participation. For search links to base your search on, see <https://hacktoberfe.st/contributors>. Issue age and labels do not matter - as long as the repo is opted in, you can contribute to it. For sufficiently old issues, it may be a good idea to ask if the issue is still current before spending time on it. See <https://hacktoberfest.com/contributors> and <https://opensource.guide> for general contribution advice.
