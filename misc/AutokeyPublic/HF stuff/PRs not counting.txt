There's a few possible causes for a PR not counting. On the HF website, if you're seeing...
* **"Excluded"**: the repo violates [Hacktoberfest's values](<https://hacktoberfest.com/values>). For more details about exclusion, see <https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details>. You can also run `/faq Why does my PR say 'Excluded Project'?` for more information. This has no consequences for you; PRs to that repo simply will not count.
* **"Not participating"**: the repo doesn't participate, and PRs to it will not count, unless the PR gets the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label. You can also ask the repo maintainers to add the `hacktoberfest` topic to the repo. Note that contributing to non-participating repos is not a bad thing. The goal of Hacktoberfest is to get more people involved with open-source
* **"Not accepted"**: your PR has either not been merged, or the system hasn't updated yet. If your PR hasn't been merged, it will not count until it is merged. If your PR has been merged, be patient. The system updates at some point within 15 minutes to 6 hours. The update is not urgent, and Hacktoberfest is not a race.
* **"In review"** and a timer not at 0: your PR is going through a mandatory and fixed 7 day period to allow for time to review repositories. This is to make sure spam repos are excluded. The period ends after exactly 7 days. Be patient.
* **"In review"**, but the timer is at 0: be patient. The system does not update the second the timer hits 0. It'll take between 15 minutes and 6 hours to do the update. Please be patient, it'll be updated soon enough.
